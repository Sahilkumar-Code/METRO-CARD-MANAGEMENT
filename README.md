This Flask web application facilitates user registration, login, and management of metro cards, alongside a feedback system. Users can sign up, log in, view their metro cards, recharge card balances, and check transaction history. They can also submit feedback. Administrators have additional privileges to manage user accounts, including deleting users and their associated cards, as well as handling feedback submissions. The application leverages MySQL for data storage and Flask-MySQLdb for database interaction, with Flask's session management for user authentication. Overall, it offers a streamlined platform for metro card management and user engagement.
